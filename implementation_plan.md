# Zork AI Agent Implementation Plan

## Completed Components

1. ✅ **Project Structure Setup**
   - Basic directory structure
   - Environment configuration
   - Documentation

2. ✅ **Mock Environment Implementation**
   - Location and object modeling
   - Action processing
   - Game state management
   - Added 'upstairs' location

3. ✅ **Agent Memory System**
   - Observation and action history
   - Location tracking
   - Inventory management

4. ✅ **Rule-Based Planner**
   - Basic action generation
   - Exploration logic
   - Action validation

5. ✅ **LLM-Based Planner**
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Context window management
   - Fallback to rule-based planning
   - API key management

6. ✅ **LangGraph Workflow**
   - Observe-Think-Act loop
   - Two-level control flow
   - Explicit reasoning
   - Workflow documentation

7. ✅ **Unit Tests**
   - Tests for rule-based planner
   - Tests for LLM-based planner
   - Tests for LangGraph workflow
   - Mock environment for testing

## Remaining Implementation Steps

1. **Make Tool-Use More Explicit**
   - Define explicit tool classes for different action types (MovementTool, ExamineTool, etc.)
   - Add tool descriptions and documentation
   - Implement tool selection logic in the workflow
   - Update the agent to use the tool framework
   - Add tests for the tool framework

2. **Integrate LangView**
   - Set up LangView for workflow visualization
   - Configure tracing for the LangGraph workflow
   - Add instrumentation to capture agent reasoning
   - Create visualization dashboard
   - Document LangView integration

3. **Replace Mock Environment with Real Implementation**
   - Integrate with Z-machine interpreter (e.g., Frotz or Jericho)
   - Implement adapter for the real Zork game
   - Handle text parsing and response extraction
   - Add support for saving and loading game states
   - Update tests to work with the real environment

## Technical Considerations

1. **Tool Framework Design**
   - Consider using a standard format like OpenAI's function calling API
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
   - Design for extensibility to add new tools easily

2. **LangView Integration**
   - Determine the appropriate level of instrumentation
   - Balance performance with observability
   - Consider privacy and security implications

3. **Real Environment Integration**
   - Handle differences between mock and real environments
   - Manage dependencies on external libraries
   - Consider performance implications
   - Ensure robust error handling

## Implementation Approach

For each remaining step:

1. **Design Phase**
   - Create detailed design document
   - Define interfaces and data structures
   - Identify potential challenges and solutions

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add tests for new components
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Integrate with existing components
   - Update documentation
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

4. **Evaluation Phase**
   - Measure performance and effectiveness
   - Identify areas for improvement
   - Document lessons learned
