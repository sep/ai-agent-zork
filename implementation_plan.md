## Completed Components (continued)

8. âœ… **Implement Structured Tool Framework**
   - âœ… Create MCP server tools in TypeScript
   - âœ… Implement direct tool definition retrieval from MCP server:
     - Agents dynamically retrieve tool definitions and examples from the server
     - MCP server serves as the single source of truth for tool definitions
     - No need for intermediate YAML definitions or code generation
   - âœ… Update the agent to use the tool framework:
     - Modified the agent's action selection logic to use server-provided tool definitions
     - Updated the execution logic to call the appropriate tools
     - Implemented robust error handling with prominent warning messages
   - âœ… Integrate with LangGraph workflow:
     - Updated the workflow to use the tool framework
     - Added tool selection step to the workflow
     - Ensured proper handling of tool results
   - âœ… Test the implementation:
     - Verified that both agents can retrieve and use tool definitions from the server
     - Tested fallback mechanisms when the server is unavailable
     - Confirmed that warning messages are displayed appropriately

### Server-Based Tool Definition Approach

The tool framework uses a server-based approach where tools are defined in the MCP server and retrieved dynamically by the agents at runtime. This ensures consistency between different agents and makes it easier to add new tools in the future.

Benefits of this approach:
- Single source of truth (the MCP server)
- Dynamic tool discovery at runtime
- Consistent tool usage across different agents
- Robust error handling with fallback mechanisms
- No need for intermediate code generation steps

## Current Implementation: LangView Integration

1. **Integrate LangView** (In Progress)
   - ðŸ”„ Set up LangView for workflow visualization:
     - Install and configure LangView
     - Set up the necessary dependencies
     - Create basic visualization configuration
   - ðŸ”„ Configure tracing for the LangGraph workflow:
     - Add tracing hooks to the LangGraph workflow
     - Ensure all relevant steps are captured
     - Configure appropriate detail level for traces
   - ðŸ”„ Add instrumentation to capture agent reasoning:
     - Instrument the agent's thought process
     - Capture tool selection and execution
     - Record observations and state changes
   - ðŸ”„ Create visualization dashboard:
     - Design informative visualizations
     - Create interactive dashboard
     - Ensure usability and clarity
   - ðŸ”„ Document LangView integration:
     - Create usage documentation
     - Provide examples of common visualization tasks
     - Explain how to interpret the visualizations

## Future Implementation Steps

1. **Replace Mock Environment with Real Implementation**
   - Integrate with Z-machine interpreter (e.g., Frotz or Jericho)
   - Implement adapter for the real Zork game
   - Handle text parsing and response extraction
   - Add support for saving and loading game states
   - Update tests to work with the real environment

2. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
   - Configure automated testing on commits and pull requests
   - Implement code quality checks (linting, type checking)
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Create automated build and release process
   - Document CI/CD workflow

## Technical Considerations

1. **Tool Framework Design**
   - Server-based tool definition approach
   - Dynamic tool discovery at runtime
   - Robust error handling with fallback mechanisms
   - Clear warning messages for error conditions
   - Singleton MCP client for efficient server communication

2. **LangView Integration**
   - Determine the appropriate level of instrumentation
   - Balance performance with observability
   - Consider privacy and security implications

3. **Real Environment Integration**
   - Handle differences between mock and real environments
   - Manage dependencies on external libraries
   - Consider performance implications
   - Ensure robust error handling

4. **CI/CD Implementation**
   - Select appropriate GitHub Actions workflows
   - Determine test environment requirements
   - Balance comprehensive testing with execution time
   - Handle API key management securely in CI environment
   - Consider matrix testing across Python versions
