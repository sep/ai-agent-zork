"""
Memory module for the Zork AI agent.

This module provides the memory system for the agent, allowing it to:
1. Store observations and actions
2. Track game state changes
3. Retrieve historical information

The memory system is implemented using a bottom-up approach, starting with
basic storage and gradually adding more complex features.
